# The Simpl PHP Project

## Making it _Simpl_ to build PHP apps that don't suck&#174;

<strong><em>Let's face it. If I want to build a large enterprise PHP application, I'm probably going to use a major framework.</em></strong>

But sometimes I just need to build a quick and dirty app. Maybe it's for an internal tool or just a quick proof of
concept. In those cases, implementing something with a full blown framework is overkill.  

After 20+ years of software development, I've grown to appreciate the beauty of simplicity. The goal of this project is
to provide small components needed to get stuff done with as little friction as possible.

I'm starting with a [wrapper for PDO](/components/sql) and a [configuration library](/components/config), because those
are the components I've needed myself most recently. I expect more components to come, including lightweight skeletons
for solving common problems.
